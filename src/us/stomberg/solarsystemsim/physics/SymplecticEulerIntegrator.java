/**
 * Implementation of the Integrator interface using the Symplectic Euler method,
 * also known as Semi-implicit Euler method.
 * <p>
 * The Symplectic Euler method is a first-order numerical integration technique
 * that updates velocities and positions in a specific sequence:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>First, velocity is updated: v(t+dt) = v(t) + a(t)*dt</li>
 *   <li>Then, position is updated using the new velocity: x(t+dt) = x(t) + v(t+dt)*dt</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This sequence is crucial - unlike the Explicit Euler method that uses v(t) to update
 * position, the Symplectic Euler method uses the newly calculated v(t+dt), which
 * provides important benefits:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Energy Conservation</b>: Preserves the Hamiltonian structure of mechanical
 *       systems, meaning energy is bounded over long simulations</li>
 *   <li><b>Stability</b>: More stable than the standard Euler method for orbital mechanics</li>
 *   <li><b>Symplecticity</b>: Preserves the phase space volume, a key property for
 *       accurate long-term simulations of conservative systems</li>
 *   <li><b>Efficiency</b>: Offers improved stability and energy conservation at minimal
 *       additional computational cost compared to Explicit Euler</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This integrator is particularly well-suited for gravitational simulations and
 * celestial mechanics, where long-term energy conservation is critical for accurate
 * trajectory prediction.
 * <p>

     * Predicts a body's future position and velocity using the Symplectic Euler method.
     * <p>
     * This implementation follows the key sequence that defines Symplectic Euler:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>First velocity update: v_{n+1} = v_n + a_n * dt</li>
     *   <li>Then position update using new velocity: x_{n+1} = x_n + v_{n+1} * dt</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * This ordering is what makes the method "symplectic" - by using the updated velocity
     * to advance the position. The algorithm preserves certain geometric properties of
     * the physical system, particularly for Hamiltonian systems like gravitational motion.
     * <p>
     * Though still a first-order method (like Explicit Euler), this approach provides
     * better stability for oscillatory systems and conserves energy over long simulations.
