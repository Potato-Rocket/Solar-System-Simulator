/**
 * The GravityCalculator class calculates gravitational forces between celestial bodies
 * in the simulation using Newton's law of universal gravitation.
 * <p>
 * This class efficiently computes the N-body gravitational interactions by:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Pre-allocating force vectors to minimize garbage collection</li>
 *   <li>Using a single reusable vector for intermediate calculations</li>
 *   <li>Applying the principle of action and reaction (Newton's third law) to reduce computations</li>
 *   <li>Calculating forces only for unique pairs of bodies (i,j where i&lt;j)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Newton's law of universal gravitation states that the force between two bodies is:
 * <pre>F = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r²</pre>
 * where:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>F is the gravitational force between the bodies</li>
 *   <li>G is the gravitational constant</li>
 *   <li>m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the bodies</li>
 *   <li>r is the distance between the centers of the bodies</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The direction of the force is along the line connecting the bodies, with
 * equal and opposite forces applied to each body (Newton's third law).
