 * The TimeStep class manages the temporal progression of the physics simulation.
 * <p>
 * This class provides mechanisms to:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Track the total simulation time step</li>
 *   <li>Subdivide time steps when handling collisions</li>
 *   <li>Track elapsed and remaining time within each step</li>
 *   <li>Provide a clean reset mechanism between simulation iterations</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * TimeStep plays a crucial role in collision handling, allowing the simulation to
 * advance precisely to the moment of collision rather than using the full time step,
 * which ensures accurate physical interactions between bodies.
 * <p>
 * The class maintains three key time values:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>dt: The total time step duration</li>
 *   <li>elapsed: How much of the current time step has been processed</li>
 *   <li>remaining: How much of the current time step is left to process</li>
