/**
 * The Vector3D class represents a three-dimensional vector with x, y, and z components.
 * <p>
 * This immutable data structure serves as a fundamental building block for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Representing positions in 3D space</li>
 *   <li>Storing velocities and accelerations of bodies</li>
 *   <li>Calculating gravitational forces and trajectories</li>
 *   <li>Performing vector mathematics (addition, scaling, normalization, etc.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The class provides both immutable operations (which return new Vector3D instances) and
 * mutable operations (with "InPlace" suffix, which modify the current instance). The mutable
 * operations support method chaining for composing complex vector operations efficiently.
 * <p>
 * Vector3D implements essential vector mathematics including addition, subtraction,
 * scaling, normalization, dot product, and various utility methods for physics simulations.
