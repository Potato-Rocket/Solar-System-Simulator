/**
 * Implementation of the Integrator interface using the Velocity Verlet algorithm.
 * <p>
 * The Velocity Verlet method is a second-order numerical integration technique
 * commonly used in molecular dynamics simulations and astronomical calculations.
 * It updates positions and velocities using the following formulas:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>x(t+dt) = x(t) + v(t)*dt + 0.5*a(t)*dt²</li>
 *   <li>v(t+dt) = v(t) + 0.5*[a(t) + a(t+dt)]*dt</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Key characteristics of the Velocity Verlet method include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Accuracy</b>: Second-order accuracy (error proportional to dt²)</li>
 *   <li><b>Stability</b>: More stable than Euler methods for oscillatory systems</li>
 *   <li><b>Symplecticity</b>: Approximately preserves energy in conservative systems</li>
 *   <li><b>Time-Reversibility</b>: The algorithm is time-reversible, improving long-term stability</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This implementation is particularly well-suited for gravitational simulations
 * where energy conservation and long-term stability are important. The method
 * handles oscillatory motion (like orbits) much more accurately than first-order
 * methods such as Explicit Euler.
 * <p>
 * More info can be found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration">Wikipedia - Verlet Integration</a>.

     * Predicts a body's future position and velocity using the Velocity Verlet method.
     * <p>
     * This implementation follows the first part of the Velocity Verlet algorithm:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Position update: x_{n+1} = x_n + v_n*dt + 0.5*a_n*dt²</li>
     *   <li>Initial velocity estimate: v_{n+1} = v_n + a_n*dt</li>

     * <p>
     * The position update includes both the velocity component and half of the
     * acceleration component over the squared time step. This provides a more
     * accurate trajectory prediction than first-order methods, especially for
     * orbital motion.
     * <p>
     * The velocity estimate is only preliminary and will be corrected in the
     * {@code update} method once new forces are calculated.

     * This method provides the mathematical inverse of the {@code setPrediction} operation,

     * <ul>
     *   <li>Reverse velocity update: v_n = v_{n+1} - a_n*dt</li>

     * This preserves the time-reversibility property of the Verlet algorithm.
