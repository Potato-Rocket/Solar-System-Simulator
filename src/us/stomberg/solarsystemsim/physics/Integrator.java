/**
 * The Integrator interface defines the numerical integration methods used to simulate
 * the motion of celestial bodies in a physics simulation.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a standard set of operations that different numerical integration
 * techniques must implement to advance the simulation state over time. The typical usage
 * pattern involves three phases:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Making position and velocity predictions based on current state</li>
 *   <li>Rolling back predictions if collisions or other events occur</li>
 *   <li>Finalizing the state update with calculated forces</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The choice of integrator significantly affects simulation stability, accuracy,
 * and performance, especially for long-running simulations.
